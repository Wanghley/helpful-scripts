### Explanation:

- **Table of Contents**: Added a structured table of contents at the beginning of the README to provide direct links to each script category (`Auto Scripts`, `Report Scripts`, `Config Scripts`, `Utility Scripts`).
- **Links**: Converted the script category names into anchor links (`<a href="#auto-scripts">Auto</a>`, etc.) to facilitate easy navigation within the document.
- **Sections**: Each script category (`Auto Scripts`, `Report Scripts`, `Config Scripts`, `Utility Scripts`) is encapsulated within its respective `<div>` with an `id` attribute, making it possible to toggle visibility if desired (though not implemented here).

This structure enhances navigation and usability by allowing users to quickly locate and access scripts based on their categories within your repository. Adjust the content (script names, descriptions, commands) as per your specific scripts and requirements.
